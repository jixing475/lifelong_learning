You would need to __host your HTML on a publicly accessible website somewhere__, then use a webpage part object on your dashboard to embed that page.

Skip that though, generate a clock to embed here -Â [Free Clocks for Your Website](https://community.tableau.com/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeanddate.com%2Fclocks%2Ffree.html)
