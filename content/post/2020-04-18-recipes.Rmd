## select variable

When recipe steps are used, there are different approaches that can be used to select which variables or features should be used.

The three main characteristics of variables that can be queried:

  * the name of the variable: the syntax as the same as dplyr
  * the data type (e.g. numeric or nominal): nominal is character or factor
  * the role that was declared by the recipe: can define by user self `add_role`

## basic recipes ordering of steps

While your projectâ€™s needs may vary, here is a suggested order of _potential_ steps that should work for most problems:

  1. Impute
  2. Individual transformations for skewness and other issues
  3. Discretize (if needed and if you have no other choice)
  4. Create dummy variables
  5. Create interactions
  6. Normalization steps (center, scale, range, etc)
  7. Multivariate transformation (e.g. PCA, spatial sign, etc)




## step_* function custom define

+ You can define yourself step_function
+ Be clear about the specific definition of each step_function
